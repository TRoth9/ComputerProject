8-bit Computer project designed on breadboards and implemented in Verilog using a DE0-nano FPGA

This is a personal project started over the Summer of 2020 and is intented to replace the experience of an internship. This was inspired by the dissapointing number of internships cancelled due to Covid-19.

The project will consist of schematics for each module and the correspoding HDL written in Verilog. In addition, I will be performing cost analysis on each module to aim for the most economic options that still meet the desired specifications.

## Project Goals:
###### MultiSim Schematics for:
~~Program Counter~~, ~~Accumulator~~, ~~B Register~~, ~~ALU~~, RAM, MAR, Controller, Output Register, ~~Bus~~
###### Verilog HDL for: 
~~Program Counter~~, Accumulator, B Register, ~~ALU~~, RAM, MAR, Controller, Output Register, Bus
