# FPGA Computer Design 
8-bit Computer Design project designed and implemented in Verilog using a DE0-nano DE0-Nano FPGA Development Board.

This is a personal project started over the Summer of 2020 and is intented to replace the experience of an internship. This was inspired by the dissapointing number of internships cancelled due to Covid-19.

## Project Goals
The goals of this project is to design a "Turing Complete" Computer on an Altera FPGA while learning and following traditional industry standards.

## Project Status
